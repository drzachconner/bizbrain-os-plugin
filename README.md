# BizBrain OS — Claude Code Plugin

> The context layer that teaches AI your business.

**The compound interest of AI context.** Every session deposits context. Every future session withdraws it.

## What is BizBrain OS?

BizBrain OS is a Claude Code plugin that builds a persistent knowledge brain from your actual work. Install it once, and Claude Code learns your projects, clients, tools, and preferences — compounding knowledge across every session.

No more re-explaining your tech stack. No more listing your clients again. No more "as I mentioned last time." Your brain remembers everything and injects the right context at the right time.

## Quick Install

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add TechIntegrationLabs/bizbrain-os-plugin

# Step 2: Install the plugin
claude plugin install bizbrain-os
```

Then open a **new terminal**, start Claude Code, and run your first brain setup:

```
claude
> /brain setup
```

The brain scans your machine, shows what it found, lets you choose what to track, and generates a personalized intelligence report. Every Claude Code session after that starts with your full business context automatically.

## Features

| Feature | Description |

| **Session Context Injection** | SessionStart hook automatically injects your brain context into every Claude Code session |
| **Entity Management** | Track clients, partners, vendors, and contacts with auto-detection and watchdog monitoring |
| **Project Tracking** | Auto-discovers repos, tracks status, stack, and activity across all your projects |

| **Brain Swarm** | Orchestration layer that coordinates all brain agents with event queue, staging validation, changelog audit trail, workflow pattern learning, and smart model routing |

## How It Works

### 1. Brain Folder

BizBrain OS creates a `~/bizbrain-os/` folder with three zones optimized for different types of work:

```
~/bizbrain-os/
  launchpad/          # Start all Claude Code sessions here (recommended)
  workspaces/         # Clone/create code repos here (lean context ~80 lines)
  brain/              # Full business intelligence
    Knowledge/        # Systems, decisions, templates, references
    Projects/         # Auto-discovered project workspaces
    Entities/         # Clients, partners, vendors, people
    Operations/       # Credentials, todos, timesheets, learning
    _intake-dump/     # Drop zone for files to process
```

**Why three zones?** Claude Code loads context from CLAUDE.md files. Different zones inject different amounts — the launchpad gives you optimized context (~120 lines) with auto-capture, while workspaces give code repos ultra-lean context (~80 lines). This means faster startup and less token overhead for every session.

### 2. SessionStart Hook

Every time you open Claude Code, the SessionStart hook runs automatically:
1. Detects your brain folder
2. Reads config, projects, entities, action items
3. Generates a context payload
4. Injects it into Claude's system prompt

Claude immediately knows your business, your projects, your open tasks, and your preferences.

### 3. Continuous Learning

The PostToolUse hook monitors your work and feeds observations back to the brain:
- New projects discovered
- Time tracked per session
- Entity mentions detected
- Action items extracted

Every session makes the next session smarter.

## Getting Started

After install and `/brain setup`, here's how to use BizBrain OS day-to-day:

1. **Start sessions in `~/bizbrain-os/launchpad/`** — This is your default Claude Code starting point. Open a terminal, `cd ~/bizbrain-os/launchpad && claude`. You get optimized context with auto-capture, all commands available, and entity watchdog active.

2. **Clone/create code repos in `~/bizbrain-os/workspaces/`** — When you need to write code, repos here get ultra-lean context (~80 lines). Just the essentials for fast development. Brain commands still work.

3. **Use `~/bizbrain-os/brain/` for deep operations** — Full brain context loads here (~300 lines). Use this for entity management, intake processing, or brain administration.

**Why this structure?** Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md files from your working directory. By starting in different zones, you control how much context gets injected — optimizing for speed when coding and richness when doing business work. The launchpad hits the sweet spot for most sessions.

## Brain Swarm (NEW in v3.0.2)

The Brain Swarm orchestration layer transforms independent brain agents into a coordinated system:

```
User Session → PostToolUse → Event Queue → Orchestrator → Agents → Staging → Validation → Brain → Changelog
```

**What it adds:**
- **Event Queue** — Every tool use generates an event; the orchestrator processes them in order
- **Staging Area** — Agents write proposals instead of directly modifying brain files; the orchestrator validates before applying
- **Conflict Detection** — When two agents try to modify the same file, conflicts are flagged for user resolution
- **Changelog Audit Trail** — Every brain change is logged with what/why/source for full traceability
- **Workflow Patterns** — The system learns successful multi-agent sequences and replays them automatically
- **Smart Model Routing** — Routes simple tasks to haiku (fast/cheap) and complex tasks to sonnet, saving 40-60% on agent operations

**Enable it:**
```json
// In your brain's config.json
{ "features": { "orchestration": true } }
```

**Manage it:**
```
/swarm              # Status: queue depth, pending, conflicts, recent changes
/swarm process      # Manually process event queue
/swarm conflicts    # View and resolve staging conflicts
/swarm changelog    # View audit trail
/swarm patterns     # View learned workflow patterns
```

Brain Swarm is opt-in (disabled by default). When disabled, all agents work exactly as in v3.0.1 — zero behavior change.

## Requirements

- Claude Code (latest version with plugin support)
- Node.js 18+ (for context generation)
- Bash (Git Bash on Windows, native on macOS/Linux)
- Python 3.10+ (optional, for meeting transcription)

## Local-First Free Alternatives

BizBrain OS enables truly private, $0 versions of expensive SaaS tools by running optimized local implementations integrated with your brain.

### Meeting Transcription (NEW in v3.0.1)

Replaces Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, and similar services. Records system audio via WASAPI loopback, transcribes locally with faster-whisper, and saves brain-compatible transcripts with automatic entity linking and action item extraction.

- **$0/month** — No API keys, no cloud, no subscriptions
- **100% private** — Audio and transcripts never leave your machine
- **Platform agnostic** — Works with Zoom, Meet, Teams, Slack, Discord, or any audio source
- **Brain integrated** — Transcripts feed into intake for entity linking and action items

```bash
# Install the transcriber (one-time)
cd ~/.claude/plugins/bizbrain-os/tools/meeting-transcriber
uv pip install -e .

# Use via plugin
/meetings start          # Start listening for meetings
/meetings status         # Check daemon status
/meetings list           # View recent transcripts
/meetings stop           # Stop the daemon
```

Requires: Python 3.10+, Windows (WASAPI loopback)

## Privacy & Security

- Your brain folder is local-only and never uploaded anywhere
- Credentials are cataloged but never copied without explicit permission
- Credential values are never displayed in full (always masked)
- The brain folder should be added to `.gitignore` if placed inside a repo
- No external API calls are made by the plugin itself
